# Simple Raw & Photo Website Generator

a small bash tool to generate a simple website for other people to browse and download photos

When I bought a DSLR camera, I would shoot RAW&JPEG photos. Each JPEG photo will pair with a RAW photo, which, in case of Canon, is a CR3 file.
I would like to share my photos with some good friends. If I send them a big zipped folder, it takes time to download, and if they are not 
aware of what's inside, they may feel frustrated and choose not to download it.

So I invented this tool. It generates a very simple static webpage to show others the photos and give them options to download JPEG photo or RAW photo. 
That's it!
